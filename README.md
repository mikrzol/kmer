REQUIRED PACKAGES: numpy, scipy, pickle, jellyfish 

HOW TO USE:

Use kmerize.py as the main file to control the program. 

Bear in mind that you can skip the kmerization process with the -s argument.
Use this to control which parts of the task to perform. 

distance.py and picklify.py are here just to keep the project readable and modular, but can be used on their own if needed.
